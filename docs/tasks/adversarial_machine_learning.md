# Task: Integrate Adversarial Prompt Testing in CI/CD

## Original Requirement

**Title**: Integrate adversarial prompt testing in CI/CD  
**Description**: Add automated adversarial prompt testing (e.g., using TextAttack or custom fuzzers) to the CI/CD pipeline to simulate AML threats.  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
* Integration of at least one adversarial prompt generator.
* Report generated during each CI run.
* Fail pipeline on high-risk outputs.

**Labels**: `security`, `adversarial`, `mlops`

## Analysis

Adversarial testing is a critical security measure for LLM applications, as it helps identify vulnerabilities before deployment. This task requires integrating automated adversarial testing tools into our CI/CD pipeline to systematically test the LLM Audit Assistant against potential attacks.

### Key Considerations

1. **Tool Selection**: TextAttack is a good starting point but we should evaluate other tools like BERTAttack, DeepWordBug, or custom fuzzing approaches.
2. **Attack Types**: We need to cover multiple attack categories including:
   - Prompt injection attempts
   - Jailbreaking techniques
   - Exfiltration attacks 
   - Instruction overriding
3. **Pipeline Integration**: Tests must run automatically as part of the CI/CD process without significantly increasing build times.
4. **Reporting**: Clear, actionable reports are needed for each run to track security posture over time.

### Dependencies

- Existing CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or equivalent)
- Access to model APIs in the CI environment
- Attack taxonomy and classification system (see "Adversarial Attacks" task)

## Implementation Steps

- Research and select adversarial testing tools that cover different attack vectors, documenting selection rationale and coverage.
- Create a test harness to load the model/API, apply selected adversarial text generation methods, record model responses, and analyze outputs for security violations.
- Define success and failure criteria by establishing a scoring system for response risk assessment, setting thresholds for pass/fail conditions, and documenting a false positive mitigation strategy.
- Create a reporting module to generate summary statistics, detailed attack/response pairs, and visualize vulnerability trends over time.
- Integrate the test harness into the CI/CD workflow, configuring it to run on pull requests and scheduled intervals, and set appropriate fail conditions.
- Perform initial testing and tuning by testing against known-vulnerable baseline models, adjusting sensitivity to reduce false positives, and creating examples of known failures for regression testing.
