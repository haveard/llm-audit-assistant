# Auto-Updating on Detected Prompts

## Original Requirement

**Title**: Automate rule/policy updates from flagged prompts
**Description**:
When a prompt triggers a detection rule (e.g., YARA), automatically update filters or rulesets to block similar inputs.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
* Detection â†’ rule update pipeline implemented.
* Manual approval flow for high-risk changes.
**Labels**: `automation`, `security`, `devops`

## Analysis

This task involves creating a feedback loop system where rules and policies are automatically updated based on detected malicious prompts. This creates a self-improving system that can adapt to new attack patterns with minimal human intervention.

### Key Considerations

1. **Detection Sources**:
   - YARA rule matches
   - Vector similarity detections
   - Anomaly detection systems
   - Other security filtering mechanisms

2. **Rule Generation Approaches**:
   - Pattern extraction from detected prompts
   - Generalization of detected patterns
   - Machine learning approaches to generate rules
   - Leveraging LLMs to create rules based on examples

3. **Approval Process**:
   - Need to balance automation with safety
   - High-risk changes require human review
   - Classification of risk levels for rule changes
   - Audit trail for all changes

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Verify new rules don't cause false positives
   - Test new rules against known good inputs
   - Measure efficacy of generated rules
   - Rollback mechanism for problematic rules

## Implementation Steps

- Design a standardized event schema for detection events, including context, matched patterns, severity, and triggering conditions for rule creation.
- Implement an event processor to handle incoming detection events, group patterns, and assess risk for detected patterns.
- Create an event collection pipeline by setting up listeners for detection systems, normalizing events, and storing them for analysis.
- Implement rule generators for YARA, vector embedding clusters, regex, and ML-based rules.
- Create a rule testing framework to test generated rules against known good inputs, measure false positive rates, and auto-tune parameters.
- Implement rule storage and versioning, including a rule repository, versioning for all rules, and a deployment pipeline.
- Design an approval interface for reviewing proposed rules, showing supporting evidence, and providing options to modify, approve, or reject rules.
- Implement an approval workflow for routing rules to reviewers, creating approval/rejection logic with audit trails, and notification systems for pending reviews.
- Set up a notification system for reviewers, escalation paths for high-risk rules, and reminders for pending approvals.
- Integrate all components by connecting detection systems to the event processor, rule generators to the approval workflow, and setting up the rule deployment pipeline.
- Create comprehensive tests, including end-to-end, stress, and security tests for the approval system.
- Document the system and provide training, including user guides for reviewers, system architecture documentation, and training for the security team.

  "severity": "integer (1-10)",
  "confidence": "float (0-1)",
  "metadata": {
    "additional fields": "values"
  }
}
```

### Rule Definition Schema

```json
{
  "rule_id": "string",
  "rule_type": "yara|regex|vector|ml",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "pattern": "string or object (depends on rule_type)",
  "severity": "integer (1-10)",

  }
}
```

### Approval Workflow States

1. **Pending**: Rule submitted for review
2. **Under Review**: Reviewer has claimed the review
3. **Approved**: Rule approved and deployed
4. **Rejected**: Rule rejected with reason
5. **Modified and Approved**: Rule modified during review and approved

### Risk Assessment Factors

| Factor | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Pattern Specificity | Very specific | Moderately specific | Very general |
| Potential False Positive Rate | <0.1% | 0.1-1% | >1% |
| Event Severity | 1-3 | 4-7 | 8-10 |
| Detection Count | >10 | 5-10 | <5 |
| Content Sensitivity | Low | Medium | High |

## Resource Requirements

- **Compute**: Moderate - mostly event processing and rule testing
- **Storage**: 
  - Event storage: Initially 10GB, scaling with event volume
  - Rule repository: <1GB
- **Dependencies**:
  - YARA library for rule testing
  - Vector database for similarity rules
  - FastAPI or Flask for approval API
  - Redis for event queue
