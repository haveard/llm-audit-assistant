# Transformer Model Monitoring

## Original Requirement

**Title**: Add token pattern anomaly detector for transformer output
**Description**:
Detect anomalous generation behavior (repetition, echoing, irrelevant tokens) in transformer output streams.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
* Anomaly detector logs flagged outputs.
* Configurable thresholds and alerts.
**Labels**: `transformer`, `output-analysis`, `anomaly-detection`

## Analysis

Transformer models can sometimes exhibit unusual generation behaviors, such as repetition loops, echoing input tokens, or generating irrelevant content. These anomalies can indicate model failures, prompt injection attacks, or adversarial inputs. By monitoring the token-level output stream for these patterns, we can detect issues early and take appropriate actions.

### Key Considerations

1. **Types of Anomalies to Detect**:
   - **Repetition**: Detecting when the model generates repeating sequences or gets stuck in loops
   - **Echoing**: Identifying when model output closely mirrors input prompts, which may indicate prompt leakage
   - **Irrelevant Tokens**: Detecting when the model generates content unrelated to the expected domain or context
   - **Entropy Anomalies**: Unusual patterns in the statistical distribution of tokens

2. **Detection Methods**:
   - Statistical analysis of token frequencies and distributions
   - Pattern matching for repetitive sequences
   - Semantic similarity measurements between input and output
   - Domain-specific keyword detection

3. **Implementation Approaches**:
   - Real-time monitoring during token generation
   - Post-processing analysis after generation complete
   - Hybrid approach combining both methods

4. **Configurability**:
   - Different thresholds for different types of anomalies
   - Customizable alerting and logging options
   - Ability to adjust sensitivity based on use case

## Implementation Steps

1. Design detection algorithms for repetition, echoing, irrelevance, and entropy anomalies.
2. Select and define metrics to track for each anomaly type.
3. Design data structures for efficient token analysis.
4. Create system architecture for anomaly detection and reporting.
5. Plan integration points in the LLM generation pipeline.
6. Design logging format for anomaly reports.
7. Plan alert notification system and define alert thresholds.
8. Implement repetition detection using n-gram analysis and sliding window.
9. Implement echo detection using token-level and semantic similarity metrics.
10. Implement irrelevance detection using domain keyword matching and context deviation scoring.
11. Implement entropy anomaly detection using token probability analysis and information theory metrics.
12. Develop a logging system for anomaly events.
13. Create an alert notification system with configurable channels and suppression logic.
14. Create a comprehensive test suite for all anomaly types.
15. Tune thresholds and parameters for optimal detection accuracy.
16. Document system architecture, configuration options, and integration steps.

### Integration Points

1. **Real-time Integration**:
   - Hook into model's token generation loop
   - Process each token as it's generated
   - Optionally stop generation when severe anomalies detected

2. **Post-processing Integration**:
   - Analyze complete outputs after generation
   - Flag responses with anomalies for review
   - Feed into quality monitoring systems

### Alert Levels and Actions

| Alert Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Critical | Severe repetition (score > 0.8) | Block response, notify immediately |
| High | Significant echo (similarity > 0.8) | Log, flag for review, notify team |
| Medium | Irrelevance detection, moderate repetition | Log, flag for review |
| Low | Entropy anomalies | Log for analysis |
