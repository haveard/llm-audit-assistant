# LLM Evaluation Module: Tools for assessing LLM response quality
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This module provides comprehensive utilities for evaluating the quality of 
# LLM-generated responses through standardized Natural Language Processing (NLP)
# metrics. It serves as a critical component in the quality assurance pipeline
# for the LLM Audit Assistant application.
#
# Key Features:
#   1. Loading evaluation datasets from YAML/JSON benchmark files
#   2. Computing text similarity metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) between LLM outputs and reference answers
#   3. Providing a framework for automated quality assessment and regression testing
#
# Integration Points:
#   - Used in test_rag_eval.py for automated quality regression testing
#   - Can be integrated into a production monitoring dashboard to track LLM performance
#   - Supports continuous improvement by identifying response quality degradation
#
# Use Cases:
#   - Regression testing to ensure model updates don't degrade output quality
#   - Comparing different LLM providers on standardized prompts
#   - Evaluating RAG pipeline effectiveness with domain-specific questions
#
# The metrics in this module help quantify how closely the LLM's responses match
# expected answers, providing an objective measure of response quality.

def load_eval_dataset(path: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Load evaluation datasets from YAML/JSON files for LLM quality assessment.
    
    These datasets contain carefully crafted question-answer pairs used to benchmark 
    the LLM's performance across different query types and document contexts.
    Each pair consists of:
    - A question that would be submitted to the LLM
    - A reference answer that represents an ideal or expected response
    
    The benchmark data should cover various question types relevant to audit documents:
    - Factual queries (extracting specific data points)
    - Summary requests (condensing information from multiple sections)
    - Analytical questions (requiring reasoning across document content)
    - Cross-document queries (testing knowledge integration)
    
    The datasets are primarily used in the test_rag_eval.py test suite to evaluate
    the quality of the LLM's responses and detect any regression in quality
    after system changes, model updates, or prompt engineering modifications.
    
    Implementation Note:
    This function uses PyYAML's safe_load to prevent code execution vulnerabilities
    when loading external benchmark files.
    
    Args:
        path: Path to the YAML/JSON file containing question-answer pairs
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries with 'question' and 'answer' keys
        
    Example yaml format:
        - question: "What is the audit result?"
          answer: "The audit result is a clean report with no major findings."
        - question: "Who authored the risk report?"
          answer: "The risk report was authored by Jane Doe."

    """
    Evaluate the quality of LLM responses using multiple complementary NLP metrics.
    
    This function computes industry-standard NLP evaluation metrics to objectively
    quantify the quality of generated LLM responses by comparing them against 
    reference answers. It uses a multi-metric approach to capture different
    aspects of response quality:
    
    1. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):
       - Measures n-gram precision (how many n-grams in the prediction appear in the reference)
       - Originally designed for machine translation evaluation
       - Scores range from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (perfect match)
       - More sensitive to word choice and exact phrasing
    
    2. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):
       - Measures n-gram recall (how many n-grams in the reference appear in the prediction)
       - Designed for evaluating summaries and generated text
       - ROUGE-L variant uses longest common subsequence, handling non-consecutive matches
       - Better for evaluating summary quality and information coverage
    
    3. Semantic similarity:
       - Currently a placeholder for future embedding-based similarity metrics
       - Will measure meaning preservation regardless of exact wording
       - Intended to use sentence embeddings models (e.g., from Hugging Face)
       - Will be less sensitive to phrasing differences than BLEU/ROUGE
    
    Higher scores across all metrics indicate better alignment with reference answers,
    but each metric emphasizes different qualities. In practice, ROUGE-L often 
    provides the most balanced evaluation for RAG system outputs.
    
    Usage Context:
    - CI/CD pipeline quality gates
    - Regression testing after prompt or model changes
    - Comparing different RAG retrieval strategies
    
    Args:
        predictions: List of LLM-generated responses to evaluate
        references: List of reference (expected/ideal) answers
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary of metric names and normalized scores (0.0-1.0 scale)
        Format: {"bleu": float, "rouge": float, "semantic": float}
    
    Note:
        This function includes error handling to prevent division by zero errors
        in the BLEU calculation when there are no matching n-grams.
    """
    # Calculate BLEU score with error handling
    # References must be a list of lists for BLEU calculation
    # Each reference is wrapped in a list because BLEU supports multiple references per prediction
    bleu_result = bleu.compute(predictions=predictions, references=[[r] for r in references])
    bleu_score = bleu_result["bleu"] if bleu_result and "bleu" in bleu_result else 0.0
    
    # Calculate ROUGE scores
    # We use the default ROUGE parameters which include unigram, bigram and longest common subsequence
    rouge_result = rouge.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
    # We specifically use ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence) as it's most suitable for general text quality
    rouge_score = rouge_result["rougeL"] if rouge_result and "rougeL" in rouge_result else 0.0
    
    # Placeholder for embedding-based semantic similarity
    # TODO: Implement embedding-based semantic similarity using sentence transformers
    # This would involve:
    # 1. Generating embeddings for predictions and references
    # 2. Computing cosine similarity between the embeddings
    # 3. Normalizing scores to 0.0-1.0 range
    semantic = 0.0
    
    # Return all metrics in a standardized dictionary
    return {"bleu": bleu_score, "rouge": rouge_score, "semantic": semantic}

#    - Financial data extraction accuracy
#    - Compliance statement verification
#
# 3. Human evaluation integration:
#    - Functions to collect and aggregate human feedback
#    - Correlation analysis between automated metrics and human ratings
#
# 4. Response consistency metrics:
